## Problem Description

To complete this milestone, you have to add the following features to your `smarter-tasks` app.

- Add another input field to accept a description of a task. The field should have its `id` as `todoDescription`
- Add another input field to accept due date for a task. The field should have its `id` as `todoDueDate`
- Title input field should have `todoTitle` as its `id`.
- User should not be able to create empty tasks, i.e., tasks without title or due date. Description can be empty.
- Each task rendered should have `TaskItem` CSS class.

```html
<div>
  <div class="TaskItem">
    <h3>Sample item (2023-01-09)</h3>
    some description
  </div>
  <div class="TaskItem">
    <h3>Another item (2023-01-08)</h3>
