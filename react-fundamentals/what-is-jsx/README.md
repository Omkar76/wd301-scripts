JSX stands for Javascript XML and it is a very useful tool for React developers. JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax similar to HTML. JSX gives us the ability to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the DOM by converting the HTML tags into React elements without the need for other methods like createElement() or appendChild(). This combination of Javascript and HTML leads to having more powerful applications with boosted performance.

```js
const myElement = <h1>Hello World</h1>
ReactDOM.render(myElement, document.getElementById('root')
```
This JSX code snippet is an example of what it would take to output an `<H1>` of “Hello World” to your DOM using JSX syntax.

You can also represent multiple lines of HTML with JSX. However, there must always be one top level element with the rest of your code nested inside.

```js

```
