Hello and welcome to WD301! 

In this course, you will learn about ReactJs. React is the worldâ€™s most popular JavaScript library, created by Facebook. It helps us to build amazing user interfaces. It runs on the browser and it makes a website more interactive and faster. You can use it to build single page applications, mobile apps, or to build complex apps if you utilise it with other libraries.

## Who else is using React?
Apart from Facebook, companies like Uber, Twitter, Amazon, Netflix, Airbnb, Flipkart, dropbox, they all rely on React for their frontend.

## Why React?
When React was first introduced, it fundamentally changed how JavaScript frameworks worked. Back in 2013 (when React was first released publicly), when other JavaScript frameworks (like Angular) were pushing the concept of MVC architecture to frontend, React chose a different approach and decided to isolate **view rendering** from the **model representation** and introduce a completely new architecture to the JavaScript front-end ecosystem. And that new architecture was so effective and easy to adapt, it became immensely popular among developers. Because, not only it helped to build interactive user interfaces, but also improved the developer experience.

So, throughout this course you will learn the various aspects of React. First, we will take you through the absolute basic concepts and then gradually we will build an amazing application together. 

So, let's get started.
