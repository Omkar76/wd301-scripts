## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to make the following changes in the *Smarter Tasks* React application:
1. Pass the `dueDate`, `completedAtDate` and `assigneeName` as props from the `App` component and to the `TaskCard` component.
2. Show the *due date* and *assignee name* in the task cards of `Pending` list.
3. Show the *completed on*  and assignee name in the task cards of `Done` list.
4. Use TailwindCss to design the application as shown in this wireframe:



One important point to note here is that, the task cards present in `Pending` list should now show the *completed on* and the tasks present in `Done` list should not show the `due date`. Means you have to apply some logic in the `TaskCard` component to make it work.

## Submission Requirements
1. Create a new public repository in your GitHub account.
2. After the implementation, commit your changes, and push the code to this new GitHub repository.

#### Well-formatted code is a must.
Remember to format the code - keep proper indentation and add relevant comments if required. This one is non-negotiable as always.

Have fun!
