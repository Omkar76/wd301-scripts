Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to create a basic typescript application file for the Smarter Tasks React application:

Create an `app.ts` file in the folder you are working with.
Add four functionalities in the application file `addUser`, `removeUser`, `addTask`, `removeTask`
The User that can be added should have an `id` for them, `name` of the user, `email` of the user and an array of `tasks` associated with the user.
The Task that can be added should have an `id` for it, `name` of the Task, and a status(true/false) of whether the task is `completed`.
Also, as stated, add the remove functionality for the above items.

One important point to note here is that, you should use interfaces to define the data structure and type annotations to ensure that only the correct data types are used in these functions.

Submission Requirements
After the implementation, commit your changes and push the code to the previously created GitHub repository.
Well-formatted code is a must.
Remember to format the code - keep the proper indentation and add relevant comments if required. This one is non-negotiable, as always.

Have fun!
