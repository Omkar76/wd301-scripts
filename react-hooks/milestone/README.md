**To complete this level**: You have to persist items to localstorage and populate already saved items when reloading the page. You also have to add capability to delete a task.

## Requirements

- Populate already saved items from `localStorage` when the page is loaded.
- Add capability to delete a task.

Additionally, make sure to format your code using `Prettier` and use `ESLint` to enforce code standards.
