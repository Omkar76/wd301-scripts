## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to make the following changes in the *Smarter Tasks (PMS)* React application:
1. Once a user completes the signup and signin process, redirect the user to `/dashboard` path. You can use `useHistory` hook from `react-router-dom` implement this feature.
2. In the dashboard page, access logged-in user's information from localStorage and print the name and email ID.
3. In the dashboard page, provide a link to logout from the account. To successfully logout, you have to clear the session and current user's information from local storage.

## Submission Requirements
1. After the implementation, commit your changes, and push the code to this new GitHub repository.

#### Well-formatted code is a must.
Remember to format the code - keep proper indentation and add relevant comments if required. This one is non-negotiable as always.

Have fun!
